Do not change the order of the headers<br>
If you're translating the entire documentation, please put the changelogs as low priority annoyingtypothatimade<br>
In text inside headers, please use the [ASCII Sort Order](http:support.ecisolutions.com/doc-ddms/help/reportsmenu/ascii_sort_order_chart.htm). If the symbols that are being used aren't mentioned in the page, feel free to use your creativity or make a suggestion<br>

## CSS Optimization:
You can suggest any change in the stylesheets that reduces the number of characters without changing its functionality while making it have an approximate readability. The current optimization methods are: 

Replace " {" with "{"<br>
Replace ", " with "," (review manually, so metadata neither commentaries are mistakenly changed)<br>
Replace ": " with ":"<br>
Replace ";`new line`}" with "`new line`}"<br>
Replace " > " with ">"<br>
Replace color values according to http:chrisnager.github.io/short-color-names/ (only replace with values that reduce the number the characters)
