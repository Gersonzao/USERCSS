# UserCSS
This is a collection of UserStyles (a.k.a. UserCSS/User CSS/user styles) for multiple pages made for whoever uses the latest version of [Firefox Extended Support Release](http:/ozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/all/#product-desktop-esr) (ESR) and [Stylus](http:addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/) (updated from the [AMO (Mozilla Add-ons)](http:addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/))

## Translating:
Avoid changing the meaning of the sencentes the least as possible, even if it makes very long sentences<br>
Do not change the order of the headers<br>
If you're translating the entire documentation, please put the changelogs as low priority annoyingtypothatimade<br>
In text inside headers, please use the [ASCII Sort Order](http:support.ecisolutions.com/doc-ddms/help/reportsmenu/ascii_sort_order_chart.htm). If the symbols that are being used aren't mentioned in the page, feel free to use your creativity or make a suggestion<br>
Your language level in the language you're translating to must be level [B2](http:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)+<br>
You can also review translations by adding TranslationReview to the top of your comment<br>

## Reporting a bug:
Before doing so, make sure it happens with the software combination mentioned above and that it doesn't happen when you reload the page. If the bug doesn't happen when you reload the page, don't open an issue

## Debloating CSS:
Replace " {" with "{"<br>
Replace ", " with "," (review manually, so metadata neither commentaries are mistakenly changed)<br>
Replace ": " with ":"<br>
Replace ";'New line'}" with "'New line'}"<br>
Replacing " > " with ">"<br>
Follow http:chrisnager.github.io/short-color-names/ (only values that reduce the size)

Before suggesting another debloat method, note that the code needs to have an approximate readability
