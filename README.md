This is made for myself and for whoever likes my styles and uses my software combination, I'm not testing it in other browsers or with other style managers. If you're going to report any bug, make sure you're using the latest Firefox Release and Stylus version

## Black OpenTabs Search
### Notes:
Planning to implement to the entire OpenTabs domain
### Known issues:
[T] Icons (except for Google) on "More" submenu on searches aren't contrasted<br>
Possible solution: Change the svg of each icon (except for Google)

Solution: Manipulate the image to have a black background (NOTE: only open an issue with a suggested image if it has no aliasing)
### Changelog:

Added black borders to search bar and auto-complete suggestions<br>
Fixed color of hovered items in the "More" tab<br>
Fixed font color of "See more images" box<br>
Fixed color of "x" page buttons on the bottom when hovered<br>
Fixed color of the title border<br>
**1.0.1**<br>
Fixed so that it doesn't change other websites too<br>
